# Python Learning
I will be learning and coding python and I will be updating daily about my progress and understanding.
# Quiz Game
I created a simple quiz game in python. I have used while loops to iterate the program so that we can play it again. I also used if-else for conditional and scoring. At last, I also calculated the total correct questions attempted and the percentage.
# Number Guessing
I created a number guess program where the user inputs the top range of the number. Then, with the help of `random` module, the computer generates random number. Then the user have to make random guess. The program stops when the user provides correct guess.
# Rock Paper Scissor Game
I created a rock paper scissor game where I imported random module to randomise the pick of the computer. I created lists for the options and used loop for the whole game. I checked the pick of computer and the user with the help of if-else statements and at last, I calculated total wins of user and computer.
